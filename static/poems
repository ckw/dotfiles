I met a traveler
success is counted sweetest
art thou pale for weariness
turning and turning
suddenly I saw the cold
I know that I shall meet
when you are old and grey
why should I blame her
I had this thought a while ago
wan that april
tiger tiger burning bright
I was angry with my friend
call the roller of big cigars
one must have a mind of winter
I placed a jar in Tennessee
the palm at the end of the mind
this lunar beauty
had we but world enough and time
they flee from me
thus in Aulis
to be or not to be
when I do count the clock
all the world's a stage
my love is as a fever
some say the world will end in fire
two roads diverged
nature's first green is gold
there was never a sound beside the wood
when the bells justle in the tower
if in that syrian garden
this level reach of blue
the thoughts of others
something there is that doesn't love a wall
